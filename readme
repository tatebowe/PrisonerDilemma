Prisoner Dilemma is a non-zero-sum game first described in the 1950's. I read about it in a Carl Sagan book and thought it would be a fun program to simulate while learning python. There are essentially 5 different tactics with a strategy based on the iconic saying "do unto others as you would have them do to you"
